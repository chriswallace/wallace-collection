3	The Past Ahead #226	Cyanotypes once were the most advanced technology to create images. When I see one today I look at it as a beautiful relic and I can't help but put my present in perspective. In these uncertain times the technologies we use to create are threatened with sudden extinction. But I feel joy in imagining our works joining the strata of history, a fallen species, the breeding ground of creations to come.\n\nControls :\n\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nThe Past Ahead by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2022\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/the_past_ahead_226.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmbkxCeeebYb1XaJ6b95tEpzXLvYXyvCUah4G4ef8uSFiT/?fxhash=opFbqSUAiLrkyBeecjFP3JUEFTCyBiRcPV29vU8TnRJvsZTpzTY&fxiteration=227&fxminter=tz1TQgbghNyRaW21NnkzN2m49QysKUn36neS	"{\\"width\\":571,\\"height\\":800}"	7	4	t

6	el inefable momento #620	"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento" ("the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press "p" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an "aha" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/el_inefable_momento_620.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/bafybeigy6uzd2ek24fmcziglha7m47dhug3bqgbadvlwoxw4iktm5fpceu/?fxhash=onjoHpv5HPTmc1spTs5ohqqPaYpVKNQnGaCqq5xnQjiuNfYzCUM&fxiteration=620&fxminter=KT1CxP2oa1LbWuviJKGuEvSAxdkyL8nSJNy7	"{\\"width\\":601,\\"height\\":800}"	12	7	t

13	Reticulum	Reticulum is part of my continued exploration of developing deep color and texture using 100% generative approaches. For this project I created an entirely new generative color model and for the first time rendered the entire artworks using SVG making it possible to scale the outputs to any size in live mode.\n\nI wanted this series to look like rudimentary and mutating networks. Crude interconnecting webs of primordial elements. I love the idea of a network coming online in terms of self awareness. Networks seem to pervade all of life from the vast Mycelium webs in forests through to the circulatory, nervous and neurological systems in our own bodies. More inspiring for me however is thinking about the first pulses of life that evolved in microbial networks in ancient epochs and also the possibility of self awareness evolving quietly and wildly within the interconnected machinery of the internet. This series of artworks I hope are a playful expression of my fascination with this subject. \n\nA recurrent theme in all my work is an attempt to create a simultaneous sense of both macro and micro vistas. In building the primitives for this project I was inspired by images of both microorganisms and vast skeletal gas clouds in interstellar nurseries revealed by the James Webb telescope. I often have the sense when looking out into the cosmos that this might be what it's like for a cell or even an atom looking around at its neighbors and unfathomably distant cousins. In this way I am filled with a sense that we ourselves might be nodes in a much larger self aware network. \n\nWhen I’m at my desk developing a work I don’t tend to think about much else other than the code and what is directly in front of me. Mostly I’m thinking visually or just involved with technical problem solving. It is exciting and sometimes even surprising for me to see how the subjects I have been contemplating and reading about recently reveal themselves in my work. When I write about my work it may seem contrived, but I would say the subjects I write about are genuinely inspiring a series, it's just that the means by which they get translated into visual forms is often a mystery even to me.  \n\nAs a way to make this a true Long Form Project in the sense that it is not just a curated collection of generative outputs I used a list of Seed Phrases to generate each output. These are included as a feature so collectors can see them and potentially use them as a name for each piece. I started out by forming a list of words that describe the project plus a few other words related to Long Form Generative art and the Web3 space. 'Proof' is in there! Each seed phrase is then passed to an algorithm that turns it into a hash of the same variety that is generated on the Ethereum network. This hash is then passed to the algorithm and the artwork is created in the same way an standard Art Blocks project is built.	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/reticulum.jpg			"{\\"width\\":1400,\\"height\\":1400}"	15	9	t

30	Primitives #242	Our studio, Aranda\\Lasch, was formed in the early 2000s to explore algorithmic systems and generative processes as a means to understand the world around us and make things within it. Whether encapsulated in physical or computational techniques, these processes act with their own degree of autonomy from our own biases and as a result, open up new ideas and sensibilities while dismantling traditional notions of authorship. They allow one to code the possibility of discovery and surprise into the creative process in a manner that can be widely shared and because of this transmissibility, algorithms frustrate the idea of a single author, inviting speculation on the shared nature of creativity. For this reason we have always understood our work to be a collaboration between each other, those who share with us and those who inspire us. \n\nOver the years, the studio has indulged in a number of obsessions. One is the conviction that history is a generative source with which to constantly entangle. Whether it is through stories, characters, techniques, or events, history acts as a medium active with properties that constantly reshape and transform our concept of the present. We look back to move forward, like hitching a ride. It is here that we encounter Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) and his masterpiece Melancholia I (1514) to inspire a deep dive into the process of engraving as a representational technique reinterpreted through the contemporary medium of code. By scratching metal away from a plate, an inversion of conventional drawing, engraving allowed a work of art to be reproduced and disseminated widely. In addition to the piece’s masterful delineation, its allegory resonates with us as well. In Dürer’s time melancholy was associated with insanity but also with creativity. In the engraving, the winged personification of melancholy -- the work is widely regarded to be a self-portrait of the artist -- is surrounded by the tools and elements of geometry. For Dürer, as for a handful of others who came before and after, who test the porous borders between art, science and religion, geometry is a vehicle for imagination, a shadow of the divine and a portal to the infinite. \n\nThis work Primitives is a kindred meditation on infinity through an exploration of a novel geometric structure using algorithm and code, the tools of today's geometers and mystics, made visible through the anachronism of the engravers trade translated into pure 1’s and 0’s. Primitives grows through a single shape that can repeat and scale in specific ways that are never random, but rather tightly governed by geometric logics. It is about drawing infinity through a radical modularity; ordered but aperiodic. Unlike a regular crystal, whose molecular pattern is periodic (or repetitive in all directions), the distinctive quality of this quasicrystal is that its structural pattern never repeats the same way twice. Endless and uneven in aggregate, Primitive clusters can be described by the precise arrangement of a single modular part. As these small units aggregate together they form larger figures that themselves combine into ever larger movements, always a little bit different from any other. In this sense, quasicrystalline patterns have an infinite capacity to create and carry information. \n\nWe are here because this is a medium for sharing in perpetuity. In the last couple of years, on the cusp of our third decade of practice, we have watched with awe and delight a renaissance in generative work as it's adopted by an entirely new generation around blockchain technologies. This inspired us to enter this new space with our own enduring questions of form and geometry, modularity and variability, historical continuity, and the thirst for endlessness. Primitives is what we selected as our primer into generative art on-chain because both the work and the medium grapple with these questions. \n\nSome Notes:\nOn the screen, Primitives is represented as a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional figure. Each invocation comes with a sequence of projections, or rotations, around this object. As Primitives spins, there are moments when its blocks snap into alignment with other blocks  revealing its underlying lattice and crystalline nature. Each projection can be saved as a high resolution image for printing. Primitives can also be saved in three dimensions as an .obj file for a variety of uses including the creation of a physical object through 3-d printing or fabrication.

56	Bardez #149	Bardez is the Armenian word for garden. It is etymologically tied to an ancient word for paradise, but that link goes deeper than etymology. Gardens have always been small pieces of paradise for me, and hearing the word in Armenian triggers a flood of warm memories.\n\nMemories of wandering around my grandfather’s garden, plucking ripe plums and figs from their branches.\nMemories of playing in my parents yard, the scent of jasmine in the summer heat.\nOf sun warmed tomatoes in my mom’s vegetable patch.\nThe smell of dirt and grass.\nMud on my hands.\nSun on my skin.\nMemories of paradise.\n\nI hope you enjoy these gardens I’ve planted, and I hope they remind you of some warm and wonderful memories.\n \nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n - This piece uses a shader to compute the lighting of the terrain in the first frame. If you don’t have a graphics card, you may have difficulty running this.\n\n - Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done. The maximum resolution seems to be limited by what your web browser allows. I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you the progress of the render, and also show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system. N can be any positive whole or decimal number greater than or equal to 1.\n\n - Finally, collectors at the highest tier will be entitled to a signed print of their edition.

58	Tesseract #365	'Tesseract' is a generative collection drawing on the concept of the cube from oneirology, the interpretation of dreams. In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/tesseract_365.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmbdyFbir7XfKo3u2YAEgvqJdoYQUqmEs8ffD4NeEUuvCN/?fxhash=onztbAytiMdUZnnZJ3ne8o1rYSDPvAEkGYbdHXr78QBGhmnaaTu&fxiteration=365&fxminter=tz1ZBrF4AbTyhrncrF7n7ajDMQQKEx6wbSsy	"{\\"width\\":1200,\\"height\\":1698}"	31	25	t

40	el inefable momento #797	"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento" ("the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press "p" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an "aha" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/el_inefable_momento_797.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/bafybeigy6uzd2ek24fmcziglha7m47dhug3bqgbadvlwoxw4iktm5fpceu/?fxhash=opVEcbXVDu9T3WmjMYbUQvX2PvWqteekKNYJnQwfqfbYvQTGmNo&fxiteration=797&fxminter=tz1Ym9Ued9v2N2wwsrtQ52HRGGn7qDmzuUZU	"{\\"width\\":601,\\"height\\":800}"	12	7	t
76	entretiempos #453	Our lives are scattered across several time scales, and the meaning of every event that takes place depends on the time scale that we choose to define & observe them from. Yet we fail to fully comprehend this in our daily errands. Entretiempos is an artwork that reflects on this, based on an aesthetic that pays a tribute to the works of Sonia Delaunay, František Kupka and other painters from their era, recreated by the usage of intersecting rings that create a varied and rich space.\n\nThe work plays with the time scales by painting dynamically and letting the viewer pause the work, restart, set it to loop indefinitely, painting and vanishing in an endless cycle. And it can be set to be done at varying speeds, to appreciate what happens in between the time scales ("entre tiempos", in Spanish).\n\nAlso, there is a broader theme that I find of interest to explore from every work that I engage with. It has to do with the concept of what I call total cognitive space, or the total range of possibilities that can be expressed / achieved with a given scenario and set of conditions. In this case, I was interested in expanding my rendition of the works of Delaunay into a broader space. How does this approach scale with varying parameter ranges? Is the painting still interesting? Can it express something new? Connected to this, I am also interested in thinking about what emotions would mean for an artificial sentient being. We talk about artificial intelligence, but leave aside artificial emotions all too often. While artificial intelligences are indeed interesting, we fail to recognize the paramount importance of emotions in human behaviour. To this end, this work explores also the result of painting with machine-like precision vs. performing the artwork with a range of possible imprecisions. The perfection of the machine vs. the imperfection of the human, does it trigger different emotions in us humans? What will the reaction of a machine be whenever they develop a taste?\n\nThis work exposes features that deal with its time and space scales, background colour, background elements, the palettes used, certain colour accents that may happen (golden accents, b&w tones), the style used to draw the geometric shapes (fill, lines, outline), the degree of paint precision and other features that influence the final result. The user may download a PNG file at any arbitrary resolution at any step of the paint process using the commands provided for that. A brief list of commands is as follows. Please note that you need to click on the artwork first to make sure it will receive the typed commands:\n\np to pause/resume the work\nr followed by y to enter the looping mode\nd followed by +/- or any number from 1 to 9 to increase resolution\ns followed by c to save current image\ns+f to automatically save the final image when the system finishes painting\ns+m to restart and save a sequence of images of the process\nr+0 (zero) to reset all parameters and resolutions and restart\nk at any time to define keyframes, then r+0 to restart the work and it will automatically pause at defined steps, or s+i and the work will restart and automatically save an image at every keyframe defined with k.

41	Dencity #476	Dencity is a generative art project inspired by aerial views of cities with a high density of buildings. Its perspective effect, its perfectly imprecise lines, its subtle textures and its very advanced level of detail give it the appearance of a hand-drawn work.\n\nBehind the visible art (the image) hides another form of art, an extremely complex algorithm capable of calculating and drawing in 2D each variation of the Dencity project. To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/dencity_476.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmPaFpXKhSLdbFmrXXoogFngkzaXZAht1VREi5gCGMwc1A/?fxhash=ooNXn3HmgnwjxJW1z3tgzgMWNKtZv96M9KVcdEH9eKy9Z2Uncnf&fxiteration=476&fxminter=tz1Sq1PXa7hvr1zJNNGN8Ay8DKAvZsLauHL8	"{\\"width\\":533,\\"height\\":800}"	42	33	t

48	Millefoglie #104	"A mille-feuille (French pronunciation: ​[mil fœj], "thousand-sheets"), also known by the names Napoleon, vanilla slice, and custard slice, is a dessert made of puff pastry layered with pastry cream. Its modern form was influenced by improvements made by Marie-Antoine Carême.\n\nTraditionally, a mille-feuille is made up of three layers of puff pastry (pâte feuilletée), alternating with two layers of pastry cream (crème pâtissière). The top pastry layer is finished in various ways: sometimes it is topped with whipped cream, or it may be dusted with icing sugar, cocoa, pastry crumbs, or sliced almonds. It may also be glazed with icing or fondant alone, or in alternating white (icing) and brown (chocolate) or other colored icing stripes, and combed to create a marbled effect." — Wikipedia\n\nPrints available upon request: prints@stefancontiero.com\nBest enjoyed on browsers supporting Display-P3 color gamut.\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\n@stefan_contiero\n	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/millefoglie_104.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmRp3MfQD5jcKNmuW4AQJfqfxch6XoiSBvHJueWCS3SgTe/?fxhash=ooitS7uceSyzmtwwrtfgyXBVW1Pgr3jS1smZJRycGS6nXYU4A31&fxiteration=104&fxminter=tz1QYf4nhmUhpDoty7iCir4r4gQa4SWVW5Hq	"{\\"width\\":2048,\\"height\\":2048}"	30	24	t

117	Primitives #49	Our studio, Aranda\\Lasch, was formed in the early 2000s to explore algorithmic systems and generative processes as a means to understand the world around us and make things within it. Whether encapsulated in physical or computational techniques, these processes act with their own degree of autonomy from our own biases and as a result, open up new ideas and sensibilities while dismantling traditional notions of authorship. They allow one to code the possibility of discovery and surprise into the creative process in a manner that can be widely shared and because of this transmissibility, algorithms frustrate the idea of a single author, inviting speculation on the shared nature of creativity. For this reason we have always understood our work to be a collaboration between each other, those who share with us and those who inspire us. \n\nOver the years, the studio has indulged in a number of obsessions. One is the conviction that history is a generative source with which to constantly entangle. Whether it is through stories, characters, techniques, or events, history acts as a medium active with properties that constantly reshape and transform our concept of the present. We look back to move forward, like hitching a ride. It is here that we encounter Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) and his masterpiece Melancholia I (1514) to inspire a deep dive into the process of engraving as a representational technique reinterpreted through the contemporary medium of code. By scratching metal away from a plate, an inversion of conventional drawing, engraving allowed a work of art to be reproduced and disseminated widely. In addition to the piece’s masterful delineation, its allegory resonates with us as well. In Dürer’s time melancholy was associated with insanity but also with creativity. In the engraving, the winged personification of melancholy -- the work is widely regarded to be a self-portrait of the artist -- is surrounded by the tools and elements of geometry. For Dürer, as for a handful of others who came before and after, who test the porous borders between art, science and religion, geometry is a vehicle for imagination, a shadow of the divine and a portal to the infinite. \n\nThis work Primitives is a kindred meditation on infinity through an exploration of a novel geometric structure using algorithm and code, the tools of today's geometers and mystics, made visible through the anachronism of the engravers trade translated into pure 1’s and 0’s. Primitives grows through a single shape that can repeat and scale in specific ways that are never random, but rather tightly governed by geometric logics. It is about drawing infinity through a radical modularity; ordered but aperiodic. Unlike a regular crystal, whose molecular pattern is periodic (or repetitive in all directions), the distinctive quality of this quasicrystal is that its structural pattern never repeats the same way twice. Endless and uneven in aggregate, Primitive clusters can be described by the precise arrangement of a single modular part. As these small units aggregate together they form larger figures that themselves combine into ever larger movements, always a little bit different from any other. In this sense, quasicrystalline patterns have an infinite capacity to create and carry information. \n\nWe are here because this is a medium for sharing in perpetuity. In the last couple of years, on the cusp of our third decade of practice, we have watched with awe and delight a renaissance in generative work as it's adopted by an entirely new generation around blockchain technologies. This inspired us to enter this new space with our own enduring questions of form and geometry, modularity and variability, historical continuity, and the thirst for endlessness. Primitives is what we selected as our primer into generative art on-chain because both the work and the medium grapple with these questions. \n\nSome Notes:\nOn the screen, Primitives is represented as a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional figure. Each invocation comes with a sequence of projections, or rotations, around this object. As Primitives spins, there are moments when its blocks snap into alignment with other blocks  revealing its underlying lattice and crystalline nature. Each projection can be saved as a high resolution image for printing. Primitives can also be saved in three dimensions as an .obj file for a variety of uses including the creation of a physical object through 3-d printing or fabrication. Below is a list of interface instructions:\n\n'left' + 'right' arrow keys to rotate \n'up' + 'down' arrow keys to zoom in \n'g' regrows geometry \n'i' saves image \n'o' saves .obj\n\nThank you,\nAranda\\Lasch\n2022	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/primitives_49.jpg		https://generator.artblocks.io/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/368000242	"{\\"width\\":2000,\\"height\\":2000}"	33	27	t

78	Kyma #123	Kyma (/kee-ma/, κύμα) is a Greek word meaning wave. It is my exploration of an acoustic phenomenon known as ‘Chladni Patterns’. \n\nErnst Florens Friedrich Chladni was a German physicist and musician. He was a pioneer of modern acoustics and made numerous contributions to the field. Chladni's work had a significant influence on the development of modern music theory and the technology of musical instruments. In 1787, Chladni was trying to understand how sound waves propagate and interact with objects. By vibrating a metal plate and sprinkling sand on it, he observed that the sand arranged itself into distinct patterns. These patterns are created due to the interaction between the sound waves and the plate: the sound waves cause the plate to vibrate, which in turn causes the sand to move. The sand will move away from areas of high vibration and towards areas of low vibration. This creates a unique pattern of ridges, circles, and many other shapes.\n\nKyma continues this study by adding color, light, and composition to the equation. Each iteration is a unique combination of two Chladni plates with different characteristics, accompanied by a palette, background lighting, and variational drawing algorithm. Plates interact with each other, forming patterns from the small detailed net-like grid to megalithic sculptures of unknown creatures and windows to another worlds.\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience.\n\nRendering can be computationally heavy, please be patient and give it some time to draw.\nChrome is highly recommended for live mode and high res saving.\n\nMade with love, math, and p5js. \n\nControls in fullscreen:\n[1] - save PNG 2400 x 1600\n[2] - save PNG 4800 x 3200\n[3] - save PNG 9600 x 6400\n[4] - save PNG 14400 x 9600	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/kyma_123.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/Qmd3B5bUi7k1GuaJ8xX1squcX6sopfEQrPbDeTHU2iE6SX/?fxhash=opRd3e2ZCcVBbSEWmSNu4qx6xGM7nhcQoR7SmEvtHaneKLxCTjX&fxiteration=123&fxminter=tz1UZZnrre9H7KzAufFVm7ubuJh5cCfjGwam	"{\\"width\\":1200,\\"height\\":1200}"	49	39	t

68	Inland Emotions #22	Inland Emotions\n\nOver the centuries, ancient philosophers and modern psychologists have come to the same basic conclusion. The fact is that, according to a few millennia of research, there are a limited number of distinct human emotions, predefined by the human psyche. Sometimes it may seem like we are experiencing a "new" one, but on closer inspection, we see that it is the known emotions that are superimposed. Emotions are what they are, and they exist in the same way in each of us, whether we recognize them for what they are or not. But as our history blends into a new emerging state of the world, a whole new range of emotional responses are triggered within us.

69	unbuilt #19	This is a journey through architecture that never existed.\n\nInspired by the grammatical rules behind French sacral architecture of the Middle Ages, this generative tool is meant for creating a collection of 256 plans of fictional buildings. Each plan is a unique variation on semantic relations between architectural elements: from a regular composition resembling existing churches to a dynamic aggregation of vaults, columns and chevets. But always following the same set of rules extracted from multiple examples of gothic cathedrals.\n\nEvery church has its place and time in which it could have been built in an alternative series of historical events.\n\nThis artistic tribute to the research of Stiny and Mitchell about Palladian architecture or Duarte's work about Siza takes the topic of formalizing architectural language onto a lighthearted level by moving it to a slightly imaginary world.\n\nTo zoom, press a mouse button when over the image or touch the screen.

70	For Algernon #170	I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023.

85	Ir/rational Beauty #107	Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. www.tribute-hwf.com\n\n"Since the classical age of Greece, the golden ratio has been well known as the most balanced and therefore most aesthetically perfect proportion. In fact, it is supposedly often found in the fine arts and architecture and it is certainly important in geometry. But where is the proof that it is really the most beautiful proportion?\n\n"The computer is proving to be a useful tool in exact art theory. Works of computer art are produced with the help of programs that describe the logic of the construction and its relevant measures. By varying the parameters you can vary the shapes of objects, and on the basis of the reaction of the public you can determine the best option. So it is possible to find valid rules to design works of art.\n\n"A statistical evaluation would be interesting. Please email me with your results for the optimal proportion."\n\nI found it heartwarming that in 2011, Herbert W. Franke wrote the above, accompanied with a simple functional program on a Wolfram Demonstration page (https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/IsTheGoldenRatioReallyTheMostBeautifulProportion/) titled 'Is the Golden Ratio Really the Most Beautiful Proportion?' and invited people to submit their findings to him.\n\nThe main idea behind this project is ratios, a variety of them, used in a variety of ways, such as how a rectangle is repeatedly subdivided, or how it influences the aspect ratio of the piece, or how the colors in a palette are selected. These are represented in various styles, some of which are inspired by the aesthetic of Herbert W. Franke's diverse artworks, and his openness to experimentation with new technologies, such as plotter drawings, screens, screenprints, or 2D and 3D digital renderings.\n\nThis project, while not designed to be a formal statistical evaluation, is but my fun, colorful, and humble response to your inquiry, dear Herbert.\n\n---\n\n25% of primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke, with the goal of raising 20,000 Euros so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any money raised beyond this goal will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n---\n\nControls:\n• Double-click/tap or 'R' reassembles the piece (This automatically happens every minute)\n\nNote: Some mints require WEBGL and/or may take several seconds to fully render.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Oct 2022\nArtist: @Yazid	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/irrational_beauty_107.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/Qme5QKF1t4AbpGDMKQjWfyx8v8YLG1gyk55aA6evFyuaVM/?fxhash=ooMkJ1sbnrjd1rU25bUmuKjHUAqU3s1AEZA3KypMiHcLjM5uGes&fxiteration=107&fxminter=tz1ZFsnAQ8UorVbyiMcTP63djTMDcj3rrSc3	"{\\"width\\":1333,\\"height\\":1600}"	69	53	t
86	Elevation #79	There’s so much more to our world than what we are able to perceive, let alone understand. Will we ever be able to even fully understand ourselves?\n\n–\n\nElevation is a series of 320 generative elevation drawings of imaginary structures. It is a reminder of the limits of our consciousness, and an ode to the manifold nuances that lie beyond what we can perceive, beyond what we even can imagine.\n\nAs a generative artist, I aim to elevate my own consciousness with the help of the machine. I welcome algorithms and randomness into the creation of my works, taking full control, and intentionally giving it away, always seeking to expand my imagination. For as humans alone, we remain limited to our own edifice of thought, and often fail to free ourselves from the visible, mundane world.\n\nBoth are present in Elevation: the visible and the imaginary, the mundane and the transcendent, the solid and the fragile. Where an architect’s elevation drawing marks the transition from the thought world into the visible world, Elevation remains in-between, depicting both the idea of an imaginary structure, and the structure itself.\n\n–\n\nElevation is intended for print. All holders of an Elevation NFT will be able to order the corresponding signed print in the respective paper format via andreasrau.eu/elevation.

It was called "Grass.js".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either "Garden" or "Monolith", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/garden_monoliths_125.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmeuWoPt7WNMhTxMTZmumPqqw8zcCCd1K14wCHR2WoH6b2/?fxhash=ooqSn7h2GrHCn3XmNDTif3JXWnZ2DyqiSJ4YNcGuedguN6G7Y8V&fxiteration=125&fxminter=tz1Ym9Ued9v2N2wwsrtQ52HRGGn7qDmzuUZU	"{\\"width\\":1024,\\"height\\":1024}"	35	28	t

101	horizon(te)s #102	For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.

112	For Algernon #207	I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S.

115	(kinder)Garden, Monuments #23	When Yazid and Zancan started their fxcollab journey, they knew very little about each other. They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/kindergarden_monuments_23.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmZvfCTkkAfJeWQE1ZjEKc2mZkfnNwkcA6Y2fMBcBBpPNZ/?fxhash=ooYtH4EyXP4xxd6RpX5cocqYbnTQsH9vZFxs8EPX32DhcUm1KPg&fxiteration=23&fxminter=tz1i6asBhhj3DjWLShhJaCncePohqmkw9WW9	"{\\"width\\":1024,\\"height\\":1024}"	35	28	t
116	Ir/rational Beauty #65	Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. www.tribute-hwf.com\n\n"Since the classical age of Greece, the golden ratio has been well known as the most balanced and therefore most aesthetically perfect proportion. In fact, it is supposedly often found in the fine arts and architecture and it is certainly important in geometry. But where is the proof that it is really the most beautiful proportion?\n\n"The computer is proving to be a useful tool in exact art theory. Works of computer art are produced with the help of programs that describe the logic of the construction and its relevant measures. By varying the parameters you can vary the shapes of objects, and on the basis of the reaction of the public you can determine the best option. So it is possible to find valid rules to design works of art.\n\n"A statistical evaluation would be interesting. Please email me with your results for the optimal proportion."\n\nI found it heartwarming that in 2011, Herbert W. Franke wrote the above, accompanied with a simple functional program on a Wolfram Demonstration page (https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/IsTheGoldenRatioReallyTheMostBeautifulProportion/) titled 'Is the Golden Ratio Really the Most Beautiful Proportion?' and invited people to submit their findings to him.\n\nThe main idea behind this project is ratios, a variety of them, used in a variety of ways, such as how a rectangle is repeatedly subdivided, or how it influences the aspect ratio of the piece, or how the colors in a palette are selected. These are represented in various styles, some of which are inspired by the aesthetic of Herbert W. Franke's diverse artworks, and his openness to experimentation with new technologies, such as plotter drawings, screens, screenprints, or 2D and 3D digital renderings.\n\nThis project, while not designed to be a formal statistical evaluation, is but my fun, colorful, and humble response to your inquiry, dear Herbert.\n\n---\n\n25% of primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke, with the goal of raising 20,000 Euros so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any money raised beyond this goal will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n---\n\nControls:\n• Double-click/tap or 'R' reassembles the piece (This automatically happens every minute)\n\nNote: Some mints require WEBGL and/or may take several seconds to fully render.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Oct 2022\nArtist: @Yazid	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/irrational_beauty_65.png		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/Qme5QKF1t4AbpGDMKQjWfyx8v8YLG1gyk55aA6evFyuaVM/?fxhash=ooz5Rf6wR1CkCNPWY3hdDrNThjfy7gHfBRVfzHjyd9W2z1AE2nF&fxiteration=65&fxminter=tz1gLeXAGc1Rho2UTE246xD26SapeyztMF8E	"{\\"width\\":1600,\\"height\\":988}"	69	53	t
111	Tesseract #369	'Tesseract' is a generative collection drawing on the concept of the cube from oneirology, the interpretation of dreams. In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/tesseract_369.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmbdyFbir7XfKo3u2YAEgvqJdoYQUqmEs8ffD4NeEUuvCN/?fxhash=opQDR4pVkuae6wJfsphu4QyaPm6ijT1TQ6486SyzpjkJ5Ub92wR&fxiteration=369&fxminter=tz1ZBrF4AbTyhrncrF7n7ajDMQQKEx6wbSsy	"{\\"width\\":1200,\\"height\\":1698}"	31	25	t

Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file.

118	unbuilt #43	This is a journey through architecture that never existed.\n\nInspired by the grammatical rules behind French sacral architecture of the Middle Ages, this generative tool is meant for creating a collection of 256 plans of fictional buildings. Each plan is a unique variation on semantic relations between architectural elements: from a regular composition resembling existing churches to a dynamic aggregation of vaults, columns and chevets. But always following the same set of rules extracted from multiple examples of gothic cathedrals.\n\nEvery church has its place and time in which it could have been built in an alternative series of historical events.\n\nThis artistic tribute to the research of Stiny and Mitchell about Palladian architecture or Duarte's work about Siza takes the topic of formalizing architectural language onto a lighthearted level by moving it to a slightly imaginary world.\n\nTo zoom, press a mouse button when over the image or touch the screen.

119	Escape #255	Iskra Velitchkova entered 2023 with a clear goal—to slow down. After two frenetic years she needed to take a step back and focus on developing her technique and art practice. ESCAPE is the product of this pace change, its icon, and a map guiding us towards this same freedom.\n\nFor Velitchkova the relationship between artist and machine is deeply collaborative, nurturing unexpected elements that emerge from the code. This algorithm began in systems that balance order and chaos. First a distinctive style reminiscent of architectural maps emerged. From this grew the brutalism characteristic of former Soviet cityscapes of the artist’s early childhood in Bulgaria. Ultimately stifled by this rigidity and repetition, Velitchkova pushed the algorithm further—breaking it and in the result discovering the form of an opera house, a structure that had become a symbol of freedom to the artist, the promise of losing oneself in art.\n\nThe overwhelming superstructure of architectural lines breaks the picture plane and seems to go beyond three dimensionality. By avoiding easy categorization, the viewer spends time considering the forms and making sense of the composition. It becomes possible to escape everyday concerns for a moment longer, lost in the almost mathematical task of viewing these geometries. The opera house icon emerges as an antidote to these illusive structures. This central figure is suddenly recognizable as a flat or three dimensional shape. Whether in dense black or highlighted as a central white figure, it is a condensation point, a place for our mind to rest. The images combine the icons of this escape but also serve as a visual guide to achieving it.\n\nWe are reminded of what art can offer us—mental freedom. Yet ultimately this is an illusion. Just as the opera is a staged fiction with its own rules and schedule, this composition is not real; it is a staged performance specifically created to evoke this reaction.	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/escape_255.jpg			"{\\"width\\":1999,\\"height\\":1500}"	21	15	t

122	Spatial Curvatures #82	“Spacetime grips mass, telling it how to move... Mass grips spacetime, telling it how to curve.”\n     – John Archibald Wheeler\n\nSpatial Curvatures captures the powerful and mysterious essence of the universe, depicting the phenomena of gravitational lensing, the spacetime continuum, and the space fabric. The main focus of this piece is the visualization of the warping, bending, and fracturing of light and space fabric caused by gravity. The viewer can see how the fabric of spacetime is affected by the presence of matter and energy, and how this in turn affects the motion of objects within the universe. \n\nIn creating this artwork, a particle system was utilized to create the spacetime fabric, and various shaders were used to visualize how gravity can warp, bend, and fracture the fabric and light.\n\nTo obtain higher resolution output, you can press the 's' key in live view. Alternatively you can right-click and save the preview image.\n\nDue to differences in how shaders operate in different engines, there may be slight differences between the preview image and the live-rendered output. \n\nMade with p5js and custom glsl shaders.\n\nDistCollective, February 2023	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/spatial_curvatures_82.jpg		https://generator.artblocks.io/0x32d4be5ee74376e08038d652d4dc26e62c67f436/7000082	"{\\"width\\":1121,\\"height\\":2000}"	54	43	t

Richard Nadler created stunning new textures, enabling more variation in composition and detail to emerge at much higher resolution. Leander Herzog created the code for the interplay between the layers, motion and interactions. Richter elevates the approach from Gerhard with new methods for the realtime rendering process and new features like offline-first caching.

133	Kyma #147	Kyma (/kee-ma/, κύμα) is a Greek word meaning wave. It is my exploration of an acoustic phenomenon known as ‘Chladni Patterns’. \n\nErnst Florens Friedrich Chladni was a German physicist and musician. He was a pioneer of modern acoustics and made numerous contributions to the field. Chladni's work had a significant influence on the development of modern music theory and the technology of musical instruments. In 1787, Chladni was trying to understand how sound waves propagate and interact with objects. By vibrating a metal plate and sprinkling sand on it, he observed that the sand arranged itself into distinct patterns. These patterns are created due to the interaction between the sound waves and the plate: the sound waves cause the plate to vibrate, which in turn causes the sand to move. The sand will move away from areas of high vibration and towards areas of low vibration. This creates a unique pattern of ridges, circles, and many other shapes.\n\nKyma continues this study by adding color, light, and composition to the equation. Each iteration is a unique combination of two Chladni plates with different characteristics, accompanied by a palette, background lighting, and variational drawing algorithm. Plates interact with each other, forming patterns from the small detailed net-like grid to megalithic sculptures of unknown creatures and windows to another worlds.\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience.\n\nRendering can be computationally heavy, please be patient and give it some time to draw.\nChrome is highly recommended for live mode and high res saving.\n\nMade with love, math, and p5js. \n\nControls in fullscreen:\n[1] - save PNG 2400 x 1600\n[2] - save PNG 4800 x 3200\n[3] - save PNG 9600 x 6400\n[4] - save PNG 14400 x 9600	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/kyma_147.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/Qmd3B5bUi7k1GuaJ8xX1squcX6sopfEQrPbDeTHU2iE6SX/?fxhash=oo6YadrmeviVLNoFH76DwNpgpC6PTXf1s8zszx3ntEvM9JR3KVF&fxiteration=147&fxminter=tz1TrtLbYmNckAQ7Q1E6s9i4kTU1mBjbCawp	"{\\"width\\":1200,\\"height\\":1200}"	49	39	t

198	entretiempos #690	Our lives are scattered across several time scales, and the meaning of every event that takes place depends on the time scale that we choose to define & observe them from. Yet we fail to fully comprehend this in our daily errands. Entretiempos is an artwork that reflects on this, based on an aesthetic that pays a tribute to the works of Sonia Delaunay, František Kupka and other painters from their era, recreated by the usage of intersecting rings that create a varied and rich space.\n\nThe work plays with the time scales by painting dynamically and letting the viewer pause the work, restart, set it to loop indefinitely, painting and vanishing in an endless cycle. And it can be set to be done at varying speeds, to appreciate what happens in between the time scales ("entre tiempos", in Spanish).\n\nAlso, there is a broader theme that I find of interest to explore from every work that I engage with. It has to do with the concept of what I call total cognitive space, or the total range of possibilities that can be expressed / achieved with a given scenario and set of conditions. In this case, I was interested in expanding my rendition of the works of Delaunay into a broader space. How does this approach scale with varying parameter ranges? Is the painting still interesting? Can it express something new? Connected to this, I am also interested in thinking about what emotions would mean for an artificial sentient being. We talk about artificial intelligence, but leave aside artificial emotions all too often. While artificial intelligences are indeed interesting, we fail to recognize the paramount importance of emotions in human behaviour. To this end, this work explores also the result of painting with machine-like precision vs. performing the artwork with a range of possible imprecisions. The perfection of the machine vs. the imperfection of the human, does it trigger different emotions in us humans? What will the reaction of a machine be whenever they develop a taste?\n\nThis work exposes features that deal with its time and space scales, background colour, background elements, the palettes used, certain colour accents that may happen (golden accents, b&w tones), the style used to draw the geometric shapes (fill, lines, outline), the degree of paint precision and other features that influence the final result. The user may download a PNG file at any arbitrary resolution at any step of the paint process using the commands provided for that. A brief list of commands is as follows. Please note that you need to click on the artwork first to make sure it will receive the typed commands:\n\np to pause/resume the work\nr followed by y to enter the looping mode\nd followed by +/- or any number from 1 to 9 to increase resolution\ns followed by c to save current image\ns+f to automatically save the final image when the system finishes painting\ns+m to restart and save a sequence of images of the process\nr+0 (zero) to reset all parameters and resolutions and restart\nk at any time to define keyframes, then r+0 to restart the work and it will automatically pause at defined steps, or s+i and the work will restart and automatically save an image at every keyframe defined with k.

151	unbuilt #154	This is a journey through architecture that never existed.\n\nInspired by the grammatical rules behind French sacral architecture of the Middle Ages, this generative tool is meant for creating a collection of 256 plans of fictional buildings. Each plan is a unique variation on semantic relations between architectural elements: from a regular composition resembling existing churches to a dynamic aggregation of vaults, columns and chevets. But always following the same set of rules extracted from multiple examples of gothic cathedrals.\n\nEvery church has its place and time in which it could have been built in an alternative series of historical events.\n\nThis artistic tribute to the research of Stiny and Mitchell about Palladian architecture or Duarte's work about Siza takes the topic of formalizing architectural language onto a lighthearted level by moving it to a slightly imaginary world.\n\nTo zoom, press a mouse button when over the image or touch the screen.

152	Tesseract #388	'Tesseract' is a generative collection drawing on the concept of the cube from oneirology, the interpretation of dreams. In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/tesseract_388.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmbdyFbir7XfKo3u2YAEgvqJdoYQUqmEs8ffD4NeEUuvCN/?fxhash=opQnQRXBpaKTe6aCWs4Gahgp1QTB3hYKSYdH368Tg5NcAhjz2nD&fxiteration=388&fxminter=tz1ZBrF4AbTyhrncrF7n7ajDMQQKEx6wbSsy	"{\\"width\\":1200,\\"height\\":1698}"	31	25	t
153	horizon(te)s #375	For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/horizontes_375.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmePX7dqW9WFdm1rvNc5hmVmyJ2JdWbKxpCGzyEFPTCuRT/?fxhash=oo4owQ54cBxxXecJ11EWWKWUqL22qXVuhX3945BmRA5QW88o9Nq&fxiteration=375&fxminter=tz1f1c3zAG6v2agecY7o4dk84STEyggsoDUm	"{\\"width\\":1600,\\"height\\":1334}"	51	18	t
154	For Algernon #223	I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S.

163	Kyma #34	Kyma (/kee-ma/, κύμα) is a Greek word meaning wave. It is my exploration of an acoustic phenomenon known as ‘Chladni Patterns’. \n\nErnst Florens Friedrich Chladni was a German physicist and musician. He was a pioneer of modern acoustics and made numerous contributions to the field. Chladni's work had a significant influence on the development of modern music theory and the technology of musical instruments. In 1787, Chladni was trying to understand how sound waves propagate and interact with objects. By vibrating a metal plate and sprinkling sand on it, he observed that the sand arranged itself into distinct patterns. These patterns are created due to the interaction between the sound waves and the plate: the sound waves cause the plate to vibrate, which in turn causes the sand to move. The sand will move away from areas of high vibration and towards areas of low vibration. This creates a unique pattern of ridges, circles, and many other shapes.\n\nKyma continues this study by adding color, light, and composition to the equation. Each iteration is a unique combination of two Chladni plates with different characteristics, accompanied by a palette, background lighting, and variational drawing algorithm. Plates interact with each other, forming patterns from the small detailed net-like grid to megalithic sculptures of unknown creatures and windows to another worlds.\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience.\n\nRendering can be computationally heavy, please be patient and give it some time to draw.\nChrome is highly recommended for live mode and high res saving.\n\nMade with love, math, and p5js. \n\nControls in fullscreen:\n[1] - save PNG 2400 x 1600\n[2] - save PNG 4800 x 3200\n[3] - save PNG 9600 x 6400\n[4] - save PNG 14400 x 9600	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/kyma_34.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/Qmd3B5bUi7k1GuaJ8xX1squcX6sopfEQrPbDeTHU2iE6SX/?fxhash=ookDFnm5ZWRVNCQe9gvPfYrdyQaFVs7EH3LUyKSxrkVaqi7zEa7&fxiteration=34&fxminter=tz1PB9bzCecPNF9Tp6Gy6KunwxxFA7wqJ4E6	"{\\"width\\":1200,\\"height\\":1200}"	49	39	t

170	entretiempos #654	Our lives are scattered across several time scales, and the meaning of every event that takes place depends on the time scale that we choose to define & observe them from. Yet we fail to fully comprehend this in our daily errands. Entretiempos is an artwork that reflects on this, based on an aesthetic that pays a tribute to the works of Sonia Delaunay, František Kupka and other painters from their era, recreated by the usage of intersecting rings that create a varied and rich space.\n\nThe work plays with the time scales by painting dynamically and letting the viewer pause the work, restart, set it to loop indefinitely, painting and vanishing in an endless cycle. And it can be set to be done at varying speeds, to appreciate what happens in between the time scales ("entre tiempos", in Spanish).\n\nAlso, there is a broader theme that I find of interest to explore from every work that I engage with. It has to do with the concept of what I call total cognitive space, or the total range of possibilities that can be expressed / achieved with a given scenario and set of conditions. In this case, I was interested in expanding my rendition of the works of Delaunay into a broader space. How does this approach scale with varying parameter ranges? Is the painting still interesting? Can it express something new? Connected to this, I am also interested in thinking about what emotions would mean for an artificial sentient being. We talk about artificial intelligence, but leave aside artificial emotions all too often. While artificial intelligences are indeed interesting, we fail to recognize the paramount importance of emotions in human behaviour. To this end, this work explores also the result of painting with machine-like precision vs. performing the artwork with a range of possible imprecisions. The perfection of the machine vs. the imperfection of the human, does it trigger different emotions in us humans? What will the reaction of a machine be whenever they develop a taste?\n\nThis work exposes features that deal with its time and space scales, background colour, background elements, the palettes used, certain colour accents that may happen (golden accents, b&w tones), the style used to draw the geometric shapes (fill, lines, outline), the degree of paint precision and other features that influence the final result. The user may download a PNG file at any arbitrary resolution at any step of the paint process using the commands provided for that. A brief list of commands is as follows. Please note that you need to click on the artwork first to make sure it will receive the typed commands:\n\np to pause/resume the work\nr followed by y to enter the looping mode\nd followed by +/- or any number from 1 to 9 to increase resolution\ns followed by c to save current image\ns+f to automatically save the final image when the system finishes painting\ns+m to restart and save a sequence of images of the process\nr+0 (zero) to reset all parameters and resolutions and restart\nk at any time to define keyframes, then r+0 to restart the work and it will automatically pause at defined steps, or s+i and the work will restart and automatically save an image at every keyframe defined with k. Reload browser to reset.\n\nThere is an Easter egg hidden in every work.\n\nFor the full project description, inspiration and rationale, as well as the full list of features and controls plus a hint at the Easter Egg, please visit the project homepage at https://www.iillucid.com/entretiempos	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/entretiempos_654.jpg		https://generator.artblocks.io/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/267000654	"{\\"width\\":1540,\\"height\\":2000}"	11	7	t

The latenttuce project has started more than 4 years ago with the main goal to present humble and familiar vegetables afresh as unfamiliar and stunning. But oftentimes while pretty, salad leaves can’t stand on their own aesthetically - to show off their quiet organic beauty I contrasted it with the geometry of a grid adding it also as a metaphor for synergetic growth. As always, these cultivars are sourced from the NeuralBricolage terroir, ensuring their unique origin and quality.

173	Quasi Dragon Studies #252	Composites are artworks created using the 'Composite Builder’.\n\nTwo distinct approaches can be taken when creating composites. The first approach is driven by pure creativity, enabling collectors to freely experiment. Alternatively, collectors can adhere to strict joining rules, which, when achieved, can transform the composition into what is referred to as *Black Dragons*.\n\nAt its core, the project revolves around fostering a sense of co-creation and inviting collectors to feel like an integral part of the creative process.\n\nThroughout his journey, Harvey has been heavily influenced by mathematics and geometry, which have gradually become the foundation for the co-creative process. The motives behind incorporating dragon imagery and Eastern aesthetics can be traced back to Harvey's profound encounters with Buddhism and its impact on his artistic inspiration.	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/quasi_dragon_studies_252.jpg		https://public-bucket-verse-dev.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/genart/go/index.html?payload=eyJoYXNoIjoiMHhlZjcyZDg1N2FjYjRlN2VhMGZhNjg0YjM2NTdkNDM3YzMzOTU4MzdhMzU5YzMxZDViMmM1YjIzYWMxZGVmOTEyIiwiZWRpdGlvbk51bWJlciI6MjUyLCJ0b3RhbEVkaXRpb25zIjowLCJpbnB1dCI6eyIkcXVhc2lfZHJhZ29uczpjb21wb3NpdGUiOiI2NjA0NDIyKzAsMHg2MzMzNzM3ZmIxMzBmMWIwNGE4MWI4ZDg4MTE2NmM2ODY0ZTg2NGYyMWRkOTM0ZmQ3MDIzMzVkNmY3NTFkNmZmfjB4ZTc4ZGY1NDE2YTgwNzZhMGRmZWVlYjNmOTllZjY0ODg5OTA1Y2UwNmFjNDFhZDUyNzAwMmM2MDVhZmU1MDZlOCwweDQ5NDRlY2Q4MWQ0YWI5ZjMxNzIyYzZhZTIyZjFlMjYxOTI3NzVmZTI5MWIxYjkxNWQ3ZDk3ODg5ODk2NGEwYjR%2BMCwweDZhNGY4ZDY5OTUxZDgwZmEyMjgzNzIyOGYzZDQ2Yjg2ZTRmN2IzZmU3NjlhNDNjN2EyNjBjZGEyMWY4MTgzZmJ%2BMHg0N2I3ZjNjMjk0M2JiYmRhNzEwYTk0MzkyM2E2YzdlNzkwZmRkMDU3NDM1ZDM2NGU4OWJkMjM5ZDlmYWI5YmM3LEwwIn19	"{\\"width\\":2400,\\"height\\":2771}"	34	9	t
174	Escape #145	Iskra Velitchkova entered 2023 with a clear goal—to slow down. After two frenetic years she needed to take a step back and focus on developing her technique and art practice. ESCAPE is the product of this pace change, its icon, and a map guiding us towards this same freedom.\n\nFor Velitchkova the relationship between artist and machine is deeply collaborative, nurturing unexpected elements that emerge from the code. This algorithm began in systems that balance order and chaos. First a distinctive style reminiscent of architectural maps emerged. From this grew the brutalism characteristic of former Soviet cityscapes of the artist’s early childhood in Bulgaria. Ultimately stifled by this rigidity and repetition, Velitchkova pushed the algorithm further—breaking it and in the result discovering the form of an opera house, a structure that had become a symbol of freedom to the artist, the promise of losing oneself in art.\n\nThe overwhelming superstructure of architectural lines breaks the picture plane and seems to go beyond three dimensionality. By avoiding easy categorization, the viewer spends time considering the forms and making sense of the composition. It becomes possible to escape everyday concerns for a moment longer, lost in the almost mathematical task of viewing these geometries. The opera house icon emerges as an antidote to these illusive structures. This central figure is suddenly recognizable as a flat or three dimensional shape. Whether in dense black or highlighted as a central white figure, it is a condensation point, a place for our mind to rest. The images combine the icons of this escape but also serve as a visual guide to achieving it.\n\nWe are reminded of what art can offer us—mental freedom. Yet ultimately this is an illusion. Just as the opera is a staged fiction with its own rules and schedule, this composition is not real; it is a staged performance specifically created to evoke this reaction.	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/escape_145.jpg			"{\\"width\\":1999,\\"height\\":1500}"	21	15	t
175	Tesseract #431	'Tesseract' is a generative collection drawing on the concept of the cube from oneirology, the interpretation of dreams. In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/tesseract_431.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmbdyFbir7XfKo3u2YAEgvqJdoYQUqmEs8ffD4NeEUuvCN/?fxhash=onmvNgvkRop5NSoVmQznmzNybspKJjkctJd4jfFppQA6iHSpym5&fxiteration=431&fxminter=tz2VQpR54qqKN397dD8XWXfT5jEMrRYD8Bgs	"{\\"width\\":1200,\\"height\\":1698}"	31	25	t

178	Industrial Devolution #53	As the abandoned sewage planet Xnor lay seemingly dormant, aeons crept by. Erosion and oxidation recombined in plumbing, slowly causing the pipes to evolve sentience and grow to the horizon in a blooming chaos of rust, steel and concrete.\n\nIndustrial Devolution is the first long-form generative project using my rayhatching algorithm. It combines a raymarcher for SDFs with a surface orientation based flow field renderer in order to draw arbitrary 3D scenes as line art, with an organic, hatched drawing style. The SDF formulas were generatively designed and parametrized to form ancient landscapes of corroded industrial pipes and immense, ageless blocks of concrete.\n\nThe entire code of Industrial Devolution is 3930 characters, using no external libraries.\n\nWhen done rendering, the output can be right-click saved as an SVG file and plotted using a plotter such as an Axidraw. The lines in the SVG are in random order, so it is recommended to use a path reordering/optimizing tool such as axicli or vpype before plotting. This will greatly reduce the plotting time. The output SVG is intended to be plotted at A3 (297x420mm) using a 0.4mm black pen (but feel free to experiment). You can change this by adding these options to the URL:\n\n  &lw=.4 the linewidth in millimetres\n  &d=.8 the line density (multiplier to the line width, density 0.6 recommended for plotter output)\n  &h=420 how high the page is, in millimetres (width is always height * 0.707)\n  &bg=1 set to 0 to remove background rectangle (bg=0 recommended for plotter output)\n\nIndustrial Devolution was released during a live minting event at Bright Moments Gallery, Venice Beach in collaboration with Bright Moments, fx(hash) and Tender.\n	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/industrial_devolution_53.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmfAFuSMAnyGMsGDPWd3w7Q26T1H5TPp3mC1HFXLwy5mnF/?fxhash=opY3Q2sMf1JDqDPdqe2sFZLjhB8ktiH9ptyrUTDoYrRP3wtCbmM&fxiteration=53&fxminter=tz1Ym9Ued9v2N2wwsrtQ52HRGGn7qDmzuUZU	"{\\"width\\":2121,\\"height\\":3000}"	36	29	t

180	For Algernon #248	I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S.

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/a_bugged_forest_169.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmebKrkUNabQq1Yhp1QrK2EUPbUctrphu9xEmiz23bQDgM/?fxhash=onsrts5KruP2eZrtca7eFu1DJTpjbenxwaHh9DX9Vpm7ped8k6P&fxiteration=169&fxminter=tz1Q22BiuDFqfvWhMqa5txLA6zGKrqLS6Yj1	"{\\"width\\":2000,\\"height\\":2000}"	35	28	t

190	Quasi Dragon Studies #255	Composites are artworks created using the 'Composite Builder’.\n\nTwo distinct approaches can be taken when creating composites. The first approach is driven by pure creativity, enabling collectors to freely experiment. Alternatively, collectors can adhere to strict joining rules, which, when achieved, can transform the composition into what is referred to as *Black Dragons*.\n\nAt its core, the project revolves around fostering a sense of co-creation and inviting collectors to feel like an integral part of the creative process.\n\nThroughout his journey, Harvey has been heavily influenced by mathematics and geometry, which have gradually become the foundation for the co-creative process. The motives behind incorporating dragon imagery and Eastern aesthetics can be traced back to Harvey's profound encounters with Buddhism and its impact on his artistic inspiration.	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/quasi_dragon_studies_255.jpg		https://public-bucket-verse-dev.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/genart/go/index.html?payload=eyJoYXNoIjoiMHgxMDQ5MThlMDg2MDg1ZWVmMWRiYjQ2MzUwN2Y5Mjk0ODA4NDI2YzRhOTBiMzQzM2ExNzEyZWI3ZDE1OWRjZGFmIiwiZWRpdGlvbk51bWJlciI6MjU1LCJ0b3RhbEVkaXRpb25zIjowLCJpbnB1dCI6eyIkcXVhc2lfZHJhZ29uczpjb21wb3NpdGUiOiI0MDg0KzB4ZDVkMGYzODEwYTNiZTBiNDc3MmIyZmMwMTljYmM5YmUwYTc3MGVkM2JiZDNiYjkyZTM1N2ZjNTQxNTIwMjA0Nn5MMHgyNjFlNDQxOThiZGJiY2JkYTg1OTE4ZTBiYzk0ZmI1ODFlOWVjMTA4NmUyZWFkMDkxNmFmMjcyMGI2M2I5Mzg1In19	"{\\"width\\":1299,\\"height\\":4500}"	34	9	t

The latenttuce project has started more than 4 years ago with the main goal to present humble and familiar vegetables afresh as unfamiliar and stunning. But oftentimes while pretty, salad leaves can’t stand on their own aesthetically - to show off their quiet organic beauty I contrasted it with the geometry of a grid adding it also as a metaphor for synergetic growth. As always, these cultivars are sourced from the NeuralBricolage terroir, ensuring their unique origin and quality.

217	Elevation #124	There’s so much more to our world than what we are able to perceive, let alone understand. Will we ever be able to even fully understand ourselves?\n\n–\n\nElevation is a series of 320 generative elevation drawings of imaginary structures. It is a reminder of the limits of our consciousness, and an ode to the manifold nuances that lie beyond what we can perceive, beyond what we even can imagine.\n\nAs a generative artist, I aim to elevate my own consciousness with the help of the machine. I welcome algorithms and randomness into the creation of my works, taking full control, and intentionally giving it away, always seeking to expand my imagination. For as humans alone, we remain limited to our own edifice of thought, and often fail to free ourselves from the visible, mundane world.\n\nBoth are present in Elevation: the visible and the imaginary, the mundane and the transcendent, the solid and the fragile. Where an architect’s elevation drawing marks the transition from the thought world into the visible world, Elevation remains in-between, depicting both the idea of an imaginary structure, and the structure itself.\n\n–\n\nElevation is intended for print. All holders of an Elevation NFT will be able to order the corresponding signed print in the respective paper format via andreasrau.eu/elevation. Press [s] to save the image as displayed or [p] to generate a print-ready PNG image at 300 dpi.

204	Spatial Curvatures #164	“Spacetime grips mass, telling it how to move... Mass grips spacetime, telling it how to curve.”\n     – John Archibald Wheeler\n\nSpatial Curvatures captures the powerful and mysterious essence of the universe, depicting the phenomena of gravitational lensing, the spacetime continuum, and the space fabric. The main focus of this piece is the visualization of the warping, bending, and fracturing of light and space fabric caused by gravity. The viewer can see how the fabric of spacetime is affected by the presence of matter and energy, and how this in turn affects the motion of objects within the universe. \n\nIn creating this artwork, a particle system was utilized to create the spacetime fabric, and various shaders were used to visualize how gravity can warp, bend, and fracture the fabric and light.\n\nTo obtain higher resolution output, you can press the 's' key in live view. Alternatively you can right-click and save the preview image.\n\nDue to differences in how shaders operate in different engines, there may be slight differences between the preview image and the live-rendered output. \n\nMade with p5js and custom glsl shaders.\n\nDistCollective, February 2023	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/spatial_curvatures_164.jpg		https://generator.artblocks.io/0x32d4be5ee74376e08038d652d4dc26e62c67f436/7000164	"{\\"width\\":1121,\\"height\\":2000}"	54	43	t
205	Florilegium #26	Florilegium’s inspiration lies in the ancient art of botanical illustration.\n\nHistorically, a florilegium was an anthology of illustrations depicting exotic plants and creatures. These publications reached their peak in the 17th century, with notable examples such as Nehemiah Grew’s “Anatomy of Plants”, Ernst Haeckel’s “Kunstformen Der Natur” and Joseph Banks’ “Florilegium”. These publications have had a lasting impact on both science and art. Today, florilegia often document endangered plant species from specific locations or gardens and are among the most lavish and expensive of books to produce.\n\nIn this generative tribute to the ancient art of florilegia, imagined biomorphic forms compete for space in a garden based on the geometry of circles.\n\nGenerative artwork by AutoEclectus\n\nControls in live mode:\n- After the reveal animation finishes, press [s] to save a png (4000 x 5000px)\n\n@autoeclectus everywhere - Twitter, Instagram and Mastodon\nhttps://autoeclectus.art\n\n© AutoEclectus - NFT License Version 2.0 - January 2023	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/florilegium_26.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmNfYmn4pZrYUA1fVcvePXBFtgMqGms2UQEy8o9d5bfREC/?fxhash=oobNVRWFaHtUedhGrdUmycEkkvoqgQaLtx9ecRsRFfnRvmLnijP&fxiteration=26&fxminter=tz1e4YJE8dcbAnZfMntiW96ZbjYMGMwFdqWs	"{\\"width\\":4000,\\"height\\":5000}"	99	74	t

219	Quasi Dragon Studies #254	Composites are artworks created using the 'Composite Builder’.\n\nTwo distinct approaches can be taken when creating composites. The first approach is driven by pure creativity, enabling collectors to freely experiment. Alternatively, collectors can adhere to strict joining rules, which, when achieved, can transform the composition into what is referred to as *Black Dragons*.\n\nAt its core, the project revolves around fostering a sense of co-creation and inviting collectors to feel like an integral part of the creative process.\n\nThroughout his journey, Harvey has been heavily influenced by mathematics and geometry, which have gradually become the foundation for the co-creative process. The motives behind incorporating dragon imagery and Eastern aesthetics can be traced back to Harvey's profound encounters with Buddhism and its impact on his artistic inspiration.	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/quasi_dragon_studies_254.jpg		https://public-bucket-verse-dev.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/genart/go/index.html?payload=eyJoYXNoIjoiMHgxYjE1ZjBlOTA4NjRjMmE1ZDQ0Y2NlMjljMGJmODI5MTk0ZDRkODVlZjY0N2Y2NDIxNTEzYmZmNWNmMmQxMTYwIiwiZWRpdGlvbk51bWJlciI6MjU0LCJ0b3RhbEVkaXRpb25zIjowLCJpbnB1dCI6eyIkcXVhc2lfZHJhZ29uczpjb21wb3NpdGUiOiI0MDY2KzB4ZDk2ZjEzMGNkMGMwNjc3NWNkYzUwZDg3NzQxM2E2NjVmYTFjODg1NjRlYmNjYjdmOGZkY2FmYzU4MDg3ODY5Y35MMHg0NWU4YTljNzY3ZmExODdmYzk4Zjc2MWQ4ZWU1NzAzYmIyOTcwYjhlZGQ4MzZhZDY1ODRmNTQzM2M0MzU2OWQwIn19	"{\\"width\\":1299,\\"height\\":4500}"	34	9	t
220	entretiempos #865	Our lives are scattered across several time scales, and the meaning of every event that takes place depends on the time scale that we choose to define & observe them from. Yet we fail to fully comprehend this in our daily errands. Entretiempos is an artwork that reflects on this, based on an aesthetic that pays a tribute to the works of Sonia Delaunay, František Kupka and other painters from their era, recreated by the usage of intersecting rings that create a varied and rich space.\n\nThe work plays with the time scales by painting dynamically and letting the viewer pause the work, restart, set it to loop indefinitely, painting and vanishing in an endless cycle. And it can be set to be done at varying speeds, to appreciate what happens in between the time scales ("entre tiempos", in Spanish).\n\nAlso, there is a broader theme that I find of interest to explore from every work that I engage with. It has to do with the concept of what I call total cognitive space, or the total range of possibilities that can be expressed / achieved with a given scenario and set of conditions. In this case, I was interested in expanding my rendition of the works of Delaunay into a broader space. How does this approach scale with varying parameter ranges? Is the painting still interesting? Can it express something new? Connected to this, I am also interested in thinking about what emotions would mean for an artificial sentient being. We talk about artificial intelligence, but leave aside artificial emotions all too often. While artificial intelligences are indeed interesting, we fail to recognize the paramount importance of emotions in human behaviour. To this end, this work explores also the result of painting with machine-like precision vs. performing the artwork with a range of possible imprecisions. The perfection of the machine vs. the imperfection of the human, does it trigger different emotions in us humans? What will the reaction of a machine be whenever they develop a taste?\n\nThis work exposes features that deal with its time and space scales, background colour, background elements, the palettes used, certain colour accents that may happen (golden accents, b&w tones), the style used to draw the geometric shapes (fill, lines, outline), the degree of paint precision and other features that influence the final result. The user may download a PNG file at any arbitrary resolution at any step of the paint process using the commands provided for that. A brief list of commands is as follows. Please note that you need to click on the artwork first to make sure it will receive the typed commands:\n\np to pause/resume the work\nr followed by y to enter the looping mode\nd followed by +/- or any number from 1 to 9 to increase resolution\ns followed by c to save current image\ns+f to automatically save the final image when the system finishes painting\ns+m to restart and save a sequence of images of the process\nr+0 (zero) to reset all parameters and resolutions and restart\nk at any time to define keyframes, then r+0 to restart the work and it will automatically pause at defined steps, or s+i and the work will restart and automatically save an image at every keyframe defined with k. Reload browser to reset.\n\nThere is an Easter egg hidden in every work.\n\nFor the full project description, inspiration and rationale, as well as the full list of features and controls plus a hint at the Easter Egg, please visit the project homepage at https://www.iillucid.com/entretiempos	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/entretiempos_865.jpg		https://generator.artblocks.io/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/267000865	"{\\"width\\":1540,\\"height\\":2000}"	11	7	t

223	Spatial Curvatures #167	“Spacetime grips mass, telling it how to move... Mass grips spacetime, telling it how to curve.”\n     – John Archibald Wheeler\n\nSpatial Curvatures captures the powerful and mysterious essence of the universe, depicting the phenomena of gravitational lensing, the spacetime continuum, and the space fabric. The main focus of this piece is the visualization of the warping, bending, and fracturing of light and space fabric caused by gravity. The viewer can see how the fabric of spacetime is affected by the presence of matter and energy, and how this in turn affects the motion of objects within the universe. \n\nIn creating this artwork, a particle system was utilized to create the spacetime fabric, and various shaders were used to visualize how gravity can warp, bend, and fracture the fabric and light.\n\nTo obtain higher resolution output, you can press the 's' key in live view.

228	Elevation #257	There’s so much more to our world than what we are able to perceive, let alone understand. Will we ever be able to even fully understand ourselves?\n\n–\n\nElevation is a series of 320 generative elevation drawings of imaginary structures. It is a reminder of the limits of our consciousness, and an ode to the manifold nuances that lie beyond what we can perceive, beyond what we even can imagine.\n\nAs a generative artist, I aim to elevate my own consciousness with the help of the machine. I welcome algorithms and randomness into the creation of my works, taking full control, and intentionally giving it away, always seeking to expand my imagination. For as humans alone, we remain limited to our own edifice of thought, and often fail to free ourselves from the visible, mundane world.\n\nBoth are present in Elevation: the visible and the imaginary, the mundane and the transcendent, the solid and the fragile. Where an architect’s elevation drawing marks the transition from the thought world into the visible world, Elevation remains in-between, depicting both the idea of an imaginary structure, and the structure itself.\n\n–\n\nElevation is intended for print. All holders of an Elevation NFT will be able to order the corresponding signed print in the respective paper format via andreasrau.eu/elevation.

235	Florilegium #150	Florilegium’s inspiration lies in the ancient art of botanical illustration.\n\nHistorically, a florilegium was an anthology of illustrations depicting exotic plants and creatures. These publications reached their peak in the 17th century, with notable examples such as Nehemiah Grew’s “Anatomy of Plants”, Ernst Haeckel’s “Kunstformen Der Natur” and Joseph Banks’ “Florilegium”. These publications have had a lasting impact on both science and art. Today, florilegia often document endangered plant species from specific locations or gardens and are among the most lavish and expensive of books to produce.\n\nIn this generative tribute to the ancient art of florilegia, imagined biomorphic forms compete for space in a garden based on the geometry of circles.\n\nGenerative artwork by AutoEclectus\n\nControls in live mode:\n- After the reveal animation finishes, press [s] to save a png (4000 x 5000px)\n\n@autoeclectus everywhere - Twitter, Instagram and Mastodon\nhttps://autoeclectus.art\n\n© AutoEclectus - NFT License Version 2.0 - January 2023	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/florilegium_150.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmNfYmn4pZrYUA1fVcvePXBFtgMqGms2UQEy8o9d5bfREC/?fxhash=oo51MwCpjY272BU8ffJScMzH18mvX3YzeV1WEES3Eq6yYGr3d8V&fxiteration=150&fxminter=tz1XAivmYefSRJGWX9sG8wJmAwdihhaLJ8fa	"{\\"width\\":4000,\\"height\\":5000}"	99	74	t

238	Quasi Dragon Studies #289	Composites are artworks created using the 'Composite Builder’.\n\nTwo distinct approaches can be taken when creating composites. The first approach is driven by pure creativity, enabling collectors to freely experiment. Alternatively, collectors can adhere to strict joining rules, which, when achieved, can transform the composition into what is referred to as *Black Dragons*.\n\nAt its core, the project revolves around fostering a sense of co-creation and inviting collectors to feel like an integral part of the creative process.\n\nThroughout his journey, Harvey has been heavily influenced by mathematics and geometry, which have gradually become the foundation for the co-creative process. The motives behind incorporating dragon imagery and Eastern aesthetics can be traced back to Harvey's profound encounters with Buddhism and its impact on his artistic inspiration.	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/quasi_dragon_studies_289.jpg		https://public-bucket-verse-dev.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/genart/go/index.html?payload=eyJoYXNoIjoiMHgyZjkzYjI0YTJlYWMzMDM4Yjg4YmZjMzM3NzE2NzA4MTFmNGJhMzY2NTk1NGE1NGE4NmVjMGVmNDg2M2EzYmE1IiwiZWRpdGlvbk51bWJlciI6Mjg5LCJ0b3RhbEVkaXRpb25zIjowLCJpbnB1dCI6eyIkcXVhc2lfZHJhZ29uczpjb21wb3NpdGUiOiI0NjQwNisweDcwNmM3YzFmZjM3OTNhY2FjMWQxMzFmOGZjNGEzM2QyZDIxY2U2OTM5YTdmNjg3MDM3ZTMzN2NkOWRhNGZlNjUsMHg2Y2MwZTg4NDg1ZTM0YzFiMGRhYjM0ZDYyMmFkZGViZDJhZDYyY2RkNjFjMDA2Y2E1OWU5NmRiZDQ1ZjY0MzcxLEwweDNmZjkwOGE2ZDAxYTVmMTdiNDQyZTJkMWRkMWVlMTIzN2ZkNDk4YWJmZDI5NzU0ZDY0MGZjZDk0MjQ3MGEwNjYifX0%3D	"{\\"width\\":8000,\\"height\\":3959}"	34	9	t
281	Unfolded #20	A plane is repeatedly folded over itself, choosing creases either at random, or according to some pattern (like a grid). These creases form the boundaries of the individual textured tiles.\n\nOnce the folds are complete, they are undone in reverse order, recreating the original plane. With each unfolding, the orientation of each crease (as a mountain or a valley), and each tile (facing up or down) is recorded as a sequence of 1s and 0s. Tiles are colored and textured according to similarities in these binary sequences, giving rise to subtle symmetries and repetitions.\n\nWritten in vanilla JS & HTML5 Canvas.\n\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/unfolded_20.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmNhLK8N1w19yUqTKTt9PrUzhp58icUyPkwypogrv2kdbo/?fxhash=oozxTxsybi6FqDMT51Uj12iWecsWHUxufyoat9XwKQ6eVk3zZ8j&fxiteration=20&fxminter=tz1Ym9Ued9v2N2wwsrtQ52HRGGn7qDmzuUZU	"{\\"width\\":800,\\"height\\":800}"	65	52	t

282	el inefable momento #1089	"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento" ("the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press "p" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an "aha" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”.

243	Florilegium #148	Florilegium’s inspiration lies in the ancient art of botanical illustration.\n\nHistorically, a florilegium was an anthology of illustrations depicting exotic plants and creatures. These publications reached their peak in the 17th century, with notable examples such as Nehemiah Grew’s “Anatomy of Plants”, Ernst Haeckel’s “Kunstformen Der Natur” and Joseph Banks’ “Florilegium”. These publications have had a lasting impact on both science and art. Today, florilegia often document endangered plant species from specific locations or gardens and are among the most lavish and expensive of books to produce.\n\nIn this generative tribute to the ancient art of florilegia, imagined biomorphic forms compete for space in a garden based on the geometry of circles.\n\nGenerative artwork by AutoEclectus\n\nControls in live mode:\n- After the reveal animation finishes, press [s] to save a png (4000 x 5000px)\n\n@autoeclectus everywhere - Twitter, Instagram and Mastodon\nhttps://autoeclectus.art\n\n© AutoEclectus - NFT License Version 2.0 - January 2023	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/florilegium_148.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmNfYmn4pZrYUA1fVcvePXBFtgMqGms2UQEy8o9d5bfREC/?fxhash=oobdwJAHhCds4LMk7s4PCZYe5bivu1oNoPaiBbGd1EyTAVZCyEw&fxiteration=148&fxminter=tz1cHceCnSrCc6KmC83fgqwVK85actWf41gd	"{\\"width\\":4000,\\"height\\":5000}"	99	74	t

253	Hypothetically Micro #83	“Hypothetically Micro” confronts us with a dozen bold ribbon-like entities placed against flat backgrounds of solid color. Familiar on the surface, they become increasingly difficult to place, particularly in terms of scale. Velitchkova’s lyrical specimens are artfully cropped in a way that suggests we may be looking at the tail, wing, fin, or frond of a much larger organism. Yet something about the color palette also recalls the dyes used in microscopy: These forms could just as easily be microorganisms as much larger birdlike or fishlike creatures. Her work shines next to other generative artists for its elegant biomorphic forms and subtle exploration of color. Velitchkova is a magnificent biological architect, painstakingly crafting visual systems while bringing delicate new creatures to life.	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/hypothetically_micro_83.jpg			"{\\"width\\":2000,\\"height\\":2000}"	61	15	t

283	Unfolded #74	A plane is repeatedly folded over itself, choosing creases either at random, or according to some pattern (like a grid). These creases form the boundaries of the individual textured tiles.\n\nOnce the folds are complete, they are undone in reverse order, recreating the original plane. With each unfolding, the orientation of each crease (as a mountain or a valley), and each tile (facing up or down) is recorded as a sequence of 1s and 0s. Tiles are colored and textured according to similarities in these binary sequences, giving rise to subtle symmetries and repetitions.\n\nWritten in vanilla JS & HTML5 Canvas.\n\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/unfolded_74.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmNhLK8N1w19yUqTKTt9PrUzhp58icUyPkwypogrv2kdbo/?fxhash=oo3rq7dMgysR2jaax8wMdiwRxM37RJFDxZtRP5HudjyUEMnxg8j&fxiteration=74&fxminter=tz1Ym9Ued9v2N2wwsrtQ52HRGGn7qDmzuUZU	"{\\"width\\":800,\\"height\\":800}"	65	52	t

284	Millefoglie #169	"A mille-feuille (French pronunciation: ​[mil fœj], "thousand-sheets"), also known by the names Napoleon, vanilla slice, and custard slice, is a dessert made of puff pastry layered with pastry cream. Its modern form was influenced by improvements made by Marie-Antoine Carême.\n\nTraditionally, a mille-feuille is made up of three layers of puff pastry (pâte feuilletée), alternating with two layers of pastry cream (crème pâtissière). The top pastry layer is finished in various ways: sometimes it is topped with whipped cream, or it may be dusted with icing sugar, cocoa, pastry crumbs, or sliced almonds. It may also be glazed with icing or fondant alone, or in alternating white (icing) and brown (chocolate) or other colored icing stripes, and combed to create a marbled effect." — Wikipedia\n\nPrints available upon request: prints@stefancontiero.com\nBest enjoyed on browsers supporting Display-P3 color gamut.\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\n@stefan_contiero\n	https://ik.imagekit.io/UltraDAO/wallace_collection/millefoglie_169.jpg		https://gateway.fxhash2.xyz/ipfs/QmRp3MfQD5jcKNmuW4AQJfqfxch6XoiSBvHJueWCS3SgTe/?fxhash=onvxyAGE4GADhRs3GvqWAjiyHZgX5FvzVsx1uPnThXNUwFUmCh8&fxiteration=169&fxminter=tz1cyMJ3E59Q4E9yqEXGUQ4xs9RNsuwAWDQ6	"{\\"width\\":2048,\\"height\\":2048}"	30	24	t
